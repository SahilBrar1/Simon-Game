# Simon Game
A web-based memory game where players mimic increasingly complex patterns of button presses. This project is a **mini project** created as part of my learning journey and serves as a **practice project** to enhance my skills in web development.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. Watch the sequence of flashing colors carefully.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. The sequence grows longer with each level. Keep going as long as you can!
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you can restart by pressing the "Restart" button.
